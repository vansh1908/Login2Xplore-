This repository implements a student enrollment form with functionalities like:

Data Persistence: Simulates data storage in a database (replace with actual database interaction).
CRUD Operations: Enables adding new students (Create), searching for existing students (Read), updating student information (Update), and resetting the form (Delete).
Dynamic Form State: Manages form state based on user actions - disables fields on load, enables relevant fields for editing/adding, and focuses the cursor on the roll number field.
Input Validation: Checks for empty fields before saving or updating student data.
This project demonstrates basic web form development principles and data management concepts.
